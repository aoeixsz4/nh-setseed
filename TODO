* make sure random artifact item generation is consistent (e.g. what if one player already has the arti but the other doesn't)
* think about setseed interaction with bones (force bonesless?)
* make sure monster genocide doesn't affect generation
  * orcs genoed affects stolen_booty
* refine monster generation (e.g. the titan on Medusa should be consistently peaceful or not)
